To install this program, copy the entire contents of this folder
into a convenient location (we will call this the "install directory"),
then add that folder to your MATLAB path by following these steps:

1) Navigate to your install directory in MATLAB (cd <install directory>)
2) Enter the following code into your MATLAB terminal: addpath(pwd); savepath;

Note that the extract.cl and mean.cl MUST be placed in the same directory
as getClFilePath.m
