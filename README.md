# ThirdOrderKernelCode
Code for kernel extraction, and evaluate performance of it in natural scenes. 
(This repository is still under construction for readability.)

## natural scenes dataset
The natural scene database from Meyer et al. 2014 may be downloaded here (click for link).https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/data/2689637.

## Figure generation
To generate all the figures in the paper, 
1) Download the data from DryAD, store it in local folder XXX
2) Replace the field in sysConfig.natural_scene_simulation_path to the folder XXX
3) Run script Figures_ThirdOrderKernel. It is recommended to run this file each line at a time, otherwise, the number of figures might crush your monitor :p
